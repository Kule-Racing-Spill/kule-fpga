# kule-fpga

## Project setup

Install [vivado-git](https://github.com/barbedo/vivado-git#installation). After cloning the project, open the project by clicking `Tools -> Run Tcl Script...`, and choose `kule-fpga.tcl`.
You have to do this each time you open the project. The tcl file runs a series of commands to set up the project correctly.
