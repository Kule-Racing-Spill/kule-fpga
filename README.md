# kule-fpga

## Project setup

Install [vivado-git](https://github.com/barbedo/vivado-git#installation). After cloning the project, open the project by clicking `Tools -> Run Tcl Script...`, and choose `kule-fpga.tcl`.
You have to do this each time you open the project. The tcl file runs a series of commands to set up the project correctly.

To add new files to git, first create the file in the `src` directory. Then, in Vivado, add the new file as a design source. You can just choose the whole `src` directory.

### Target Language

Since Verilog is a bit hard to work with, we use SystemVerilog. It has all the features of Verilog, with some extras. See [this site](https://vlsiverify.com/systemverilog) for some examples and tutorials on SystemVerilog. Also [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) has some nice tutorials in Verilog.

### Clocking Wizard

IPs are not so friendly with git, so each time you open the project with the tcl script, you have to:
`Click 'IP Catalogue' -> Search for 'Clocking Wizard' -> Double click the IP ->â€¯Change the module name to 'pixel_clock_wiz' -> change input port name to 'clk_in' ->Â change output clock name to 'clk_out' -> change the output clock to 29.5 MHz -> Click generate`
